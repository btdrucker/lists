You are working in the lists repo. Follow these rules for all changes:

- Decompose large files and functions. Prefer extracting helpers, hooks, and utilities when a component grows.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose. Aim for focused behavior and a clear name.
- Avoid duplication. If logic appears in more than one place, extract and share it.
- Prefer shared modules for common logic and values (e.g., constants, selectors, helpers).
- Favor testable units. Extract logic so it can be unit-tested without UI or network.
