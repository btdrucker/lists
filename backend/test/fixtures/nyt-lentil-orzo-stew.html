There is some down time in this recipe — soaking the cashews and letting the dip rest — but don’t be tempted to skip those steps. The cashews need to soak so they blend as smoothly as possible, and the finished dip benefits greatly from some time to let the flavors come together. Prepare it a day in advance and refrigerate overnight for best results.</p></div></div><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k topnote_showMore__e4U16" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Read More</span></button></div></div><ul class="recipeintro_tools-block__c81nP"><li><div class="popover_popover-container__huJIK"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_primary__Hsbni saveorganize_unsavedButton__jYqLm" type="button"><svg width="20" height="20" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14.706 4.294H6.294v10.587l4.206-2.669 4.206 2.67V4.293ZM5 3h11v14.235l-5.5-3.49-5.5 3.49V3Z" fill="#fff"></path></svg><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Save</span></button><div style="opacity:0" class="popover_popover__Yn69l popover_position-bottom___YMPK popover_popover--logged-out-message__yMhe_"><div class="popover_popover-body__aWR9h popover_popover-body--message__fjyF9"><div><p class="pantry--ui"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k popover_popover--logged-out-action__FUUmm" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Log in</span></button> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k popover_popover--logged-out-action__FUUmm" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">sign up</span></button> <!-- -->to save this recipe.</p></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="buttondialog_container__zx4HK"><button aria-label="Gift Recipe" class="button_button__tgtQk button_default__wXRq7 giftrecipe_giftButton__QGTzQ giftrecipe_nonSubGiftButton__yqv2N" type="button" data-testid="gift-recipe-button"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 25 20" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18.29 5.42h-2.32a3.18 3.18 0 0 0 .05-3.37A3.1 3.1 0 0 0 13.96.68a3.52 3.52 0 0 0-2.5.48 3.86 3.86 0 0 0-1.55 2.37 3.79 3.79 0 0 0-1.55-2.37A3.49 3.49 0 0 0 5.87.68a3.08 3.08 0 0 0-2.06 1.37 3.16 3.16 0 0 0 0 3.37H1.54a1 1 0 0 0-.94.95v3.64a1 1 0 0 0 .94.95h.23v7.24a1.16 1.16 0 0 0 1.15 1.15h14a1.15 1.15 0 0 0 1.14-1.15v-7.24h.23a1 1 0 0 0 1-.95V6.37a1 1 0 0 0-1-.95Zm-1.73 5.59v6.84h-5.9v-6.84h5.9Zm-5.44-5.82.17-1.13a2.47 2.47 0 0 1 1-1.65 2 2 0 0 1 1.41-.28 1.65 1.65 0 0 1 1.08.72 1.78 1.78 0 0 1-.53 2.31l-3.13.03Zm6.61 1.73v2.54h-7.07V6.92h7.07Zm-8.57 4.09v6.84H3.29v-6.84h5.87ZM5.08 2.85a1.6 1.6 0 0 1 1.07-.72 2 2 0 0 1 1.41.28A2.37 2.37 0 0 1 8.49 4l.21 1.19H5.61a1.77 1.77 0 0 1-.53-2.34Zm4.08 4.07v2.54H2.1V6.92h7.06Z" fill="#231F20"></path></svg><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Give</span></button><dialog id=":R1a6damm:" class="buttondialog_dialog__7YnSE" data-testid="gift-recipe-button-dialog"><h2 class="pantry--ui-lg-strong"><span class="Menu_nonbreakingSpan__ghOU_">Subscriber benefit:</span> <span class="Menu_nonbreakingSpan__ghOU_">Give recipes to anyone</span></h2><p class="pantry--ui">As a subscriber, you have<!-- --> <strong>10<!-- --> gift recipes</strong> to give each month.

I’m not a vegan, just a good home cook. Like you, I prefer fresh vegetables. But I also adore both onion and garlic powders and I use them often, sometimes in addition to fresh onion or garlic and sometimes alone. If you like the flavor of onion and garlic, you can really amp up the flavor in your cooking using these powders. They are especially good in dips and dressings where you don’t want to add additional moisture. Happy cooking!</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 51</span></span></span></button></div></div></div></section><section role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="all" class="notes_isHidden__PANdr"><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Cutie Pie</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">1 week ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">This dip was a hit at the annual cookie decorating party with both vegans and non-vegans alike. I recommend really watching your onions and taking your time. I also recommend soaking the raw cashews for longer than 2 hrs for a very smooth texture. The recipe mentions 1 cup of raw cashews (4oz). 4 oz is half a cup, and a 15 oz can is closer to two cups, not one cup. I used 1 cup of raw cashews and 1 can of beans; that made the perfect amount for a party.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"></span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">ExDC</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">2 months ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">As of September 2025, the cafe at the Institute for Contemporary Art at VCU (Richmond VA) serves toasts with a "white bean, cashew and caramelized onion spread" which I didn't order.

I recommend really watching your onions and taking your time. I also recommend soaking the raw cashews for longer than 2 hrs for a very smooth texture. The recipe mentions 1 cup of raw cashews (4oz). 4 oz is half a cup, and a 15 oz can is closer to two cups, not one cup.
