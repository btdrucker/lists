# Answer Questions Before Implementing

When the user asks questions or presents unclear requirements:

## 1. Answer Questions First

If the user asks questions (even embedded in a request), **answer them before implementing**:

❌ **BAD**: Jump straight to implementation
✅ **GOOD**: Answer each question clearly, discuss the approach, THEN implement

Example:
```
User: "What happens if X? Should we do Y or Z? Let's implement..."
Assistant: 
  "To answer your questions:
   1. Currently X does...
   2. For Y vs Z, I recommend Y because...
   
   [After discussion/confirmation]
   Now I'll implement..."
```

## 2. Ask Clarifying Questions

If requirements are ambiguous or unclear:

❌ **BAD**: Make assumptions and implement
✅ **GOOD**: Ask specific questions, wait for answers, THEN implement

Example:
```
User: "Make the tags look better"
Assistant: "To clarify:
  - Should they be larger or smaller?
  - Different colors or just different styling?
  - Any specific design reference you have in mind?"
```

## 3. Discuss Trade-offs

When there are multiple valid approaches:

❌ **BAD**: Pick one silently and implement
✅ **GOOD**: Present options with pros/cons, get user input

## Key Principle

**Communication before code** - Always ensure alignment before implementation.
